# noaa-prediction
This is HW 1 of ECE 228 at UCSD.  

Problem 1: a. Predict the daily temperature for a new station (change random seed) using random forest.
b. Plot the training and test predictions (with axis labels and legend). Very brie
y, discuss the possible downsides of the model and suggest improvements.  

Problem 2: a. Predict (ONE of) windspeed, max windspeed, precipitation, OR another non-temperature variable using
random forest as in Problem 1.  
b. Try to improve your predictions for random forest. Plot the improved results for
training, validation and test data to support your answer.

Problem 3: 
Predict the El Nino 3.4 index (play with code in Optional HWp3 folder)
